VEGAN LINZER COOKIES

Ingredients

    250 g (2.1 cups) flour
    50 g (1.7 oz) ground almonds
    200 g (0.8 cups) plant-based butter
    100 g (0.5 cups) sugar
    a pinch of salt
    if needed: cold water
    150 g (5.3 oz) raspberry jam (seedless)
    50 g (0.5 cups) icing sugar

Instructions

    Add flour, ground almonds, sugar, and salt to a bowl and stir to combine.
    Add diced cold plant-based butter on top. Start kneading with cold hands.
    If needed, add cold water and knead until a smooth dough forms.
    Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
    Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut out rounds. Use a smaller cutter to make a hole in the center of some rounds. In the end, you should get approx. Twenty-five rounds (the bottom of the cookies) and 25 rings (the top of the cookies). Place all of them on a baking tray covered with baking parchment.
    Pre-heat the oven up to 180°C/356°F and bake cookies for 8-10 minutes. Allow to cool down for 10 minutes.
    In the meantime heat the raspberry jam in a small pot.
	Spoon 1/2 teaspoon of the raspberry jam into the center of the round. Top with a cookies ring and sprinkle the cookies with icing sugar.

ALL AMONG THE BARLEY

Now is come September, the hunter's moon begun
And through the wheaten stubble is heard the frequent gun
The leaves are pale and yellow, and kindling into red
And the ripe and bearded barley is hanging down its head

All among the barley, who would not be blithe
When the ripe and bearded barley is smiling on the scythe

The spring is like a young man who does not know his mind
The summer is a tyrant of most ungracious kind
The autumn's like an old friend, who loves one all she can
And she brings the bearded barley to glad the heart of man

The wheat is like a rich man, it's sleek and well-to-do
The oats are like a pack of girls, laughing and dancing too
The rye is like a miser, it's sulky, lean, and small
And the ripe and bearded barley is monarch of them all

Now is come September, the hunter's moon begun
And through the wheaten stubble is heard the frequent gun
The leaves are pale and yellow, and kindling into red
And the ripe and bearded barley is hanging down its head"

BLACK SPRUCE. SWAMP SPRUCE. DOUBLE SPRUCE. WATER SPRUCE.

=Habitat and Range.=--Swamps, sphagnum bogs, shores of rivers and ponds,
wet, rocky hillsides; not uncommon, especially northward, on dry uplands
and mountain slopes.

     Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, westward beyond the Rocky
     mountains, extending northward along the tributaries of the Yukon
     in Alaska.

Maine,--common throughout, covering extensive areas almost to the
exclusion of other trees in the central and northern sections,
occasional on the top of Katahdin (5215 feet); New Hampshire and
Vermont,--common in sphagnum swamps of low and high altitudes; the dwarf
form, var. _semi-prostrata_, occurs on the summit of Mt. Mansfield
(_Flora of Vermont_, 1900); Massachusetts,--frequent; Rhode Island,--not
reported; Connecticut,--rare; on north shore of Spectacle ponds in Kent
(Litchfield county), at an elevation of 1200 feet; Newton (Fairfield
county), a few scattered trees in a swamp at an altitude of 400 feet:
(New Haven county) a few small trees at Bethany; at Middlebury abundant
in a swamp of five acres (E. B. Harger, _Rhodora_, II, 126).

     South along the mountains to North Carolina and Tennessee; west
     through the northern tier of states to Minnesota.

=Habit.=--In New England, usually a small, slender tree, 10-30 feet high
and 5-8 inches in diameter; attaining northward and westward much
greater dimensions; reduced at high elevation to a shrub or dwarf tree,
2 or 3 feet high; trunk tapering very slowly, forming a narrow-based,
conical, more or less irregular head; branches rather short, scarcely
whorled, horizontal or more frequently declining with an upward tendency
at the ends, often growing in open swamps almost to the ground, the
lowest prostrate, sometimes rooting at their tips and sending up shoots;
spray stiff and rather slender; foliage dark bluish-green or glaucous.
This tree often begins to blossom after attaining a height of 2-5 feet,
the terminal cones each season remaining persistent at the base of the
branches, sometimes for many years.

=Bark.=--Bark of trunk grayish-brown, separating into rather close, thin
scales; branchlets roughened with the footstalks of the fallen leaves;
twigs in autumn dull reddish-brown with a minute, erect, pale, rusty
pubescence, or nearly smooth.

=Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds scaly, ovate, pointed, reddish-brown.
Leaves scattered, needle-shaped, dark bluish-green, the upper sides
becoming yellowish in the sunlight, the faces marked by parallel rows of
minute bluish dots which sometimes give a glaucous effect to the lower
surface or even the whole leaf on the new shoots, 4-angled, 1/4-3/4 of
an inch long, straight or slightly incurved, blunt at the apex, abruptly
tipped or mucronate, sessile on persistent, decurrent footstalks.

=Inflorescence.=--April to May, a week or two earlier than the red
spruce; sterile flowers terminal or axillary, on wood of the preceding
year; about 3/8 inch long, ovate; anthers madder-red: fertile flowers at
or near end of season's shoots, erect; scales madder-red, spirally
imbricated, broader than long, margin erose, rarely entire.

=Fruit.=--Cones, single or clustered at or near ends of the season's
shoots, attached to the upper side of the twig, but turning downward by
the twisting of the stout stalk, often persistent for years; 1/2-1-1/2
inches long; purplish or grayish brown at the end of the first season,
finally becoming dull reddish or grayish brown, ovate, ovate-oval, or
nearly globular when open; scales rigid, thin, reddish on the inner
surface; margin rounded, uneven, eroded, bifid, or rarely entire.

=Horticultural Value.=--Best adapted to cool, moist soils; of little
value under cultivation; young plants seldom preserving the broad-based,
cone-like, symmetrical heads common in the spruce swamps, the lower
branches dying out and the whole tree becoming scraggly and unsightly.
Seldom offered by nurserymen.

THE HOUSE CARPENTER

	Well met, well met, my own true love
	Well met, well met, cried he
	I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
	All for the love of thee

	Well I could have married the King's daughter, dear
	She would have married me
	But I have forsaken her crowns of gold
	All for the love of thee

	Well, if you could have married the King's daughter, dear
	I know you are to blame
	For I am married to a house carpenter
	And I find him a nice young man

	Oh, will you forsake your house carpenter
	And go along with me?
	I'll take you to where the grass grows green
	To the banks of the salt, salt sea

	Well, if I should forsake my house carpenter
	And go along with thee
	What have you got to maintain me on
	And keep me from poverty?

	Six ships, six ships all out on the sea
	Seven more upon dry land
	One hundred and ten all brave sailor men
	Will be at your command

	So she picked up her own wee babe
	Kisses she gave him three
	Said, stay right here with my house carpenter
	And keep him good company

	Well, they had not been gone about two weeks
	I know it wasn't three
	For our fair lady began to weep
	She wept most bitterly
	She wept most bitterly
	She wept most bitterly"

For there's Liverpool Pat in his tarpaulin hat
And Yankee John the packet rat.

Oh, mahogany beef and weevil bread,
We wish old Leatherface was dead.

Oh, I pray that I shall never see
A hungry ship the likes of she.

Oh, don't you hear our old man say,
Tomorrow you will get your pay.

Oh, she would neither win nor wear,
She's parted all her running gear."

The Golden Vanity

It's I've got a ship in the north country,

Down in the Lowlands low,

And I fear she may be took by the Spanish enemy,

As she sails in the Lowland sea,
As she sails in the Lowland low.

And up then stepped a little cabin boy,
Down in the Lowlands low,
Saying: “What will you give me if I do them destroy
And sink them in the Lowland sea
And sink them in the Lowlands low?”

“Oh, I'll give you silver and likewise gold,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And my only daughter for to be your bride,
If you'll sink them in the Lowland sea,
If you'll sink them in the Lowlands low.”

“Oh wrap me up in my black bear skin,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And heave me overboard for to sink or to swim,
And I'll sink them in the Lowland sea
I'll sink them in the Lowlands low.

Now some were playing cards and others playing dice,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And the boy he had an auger, bored two holes at once,
And he sunk them in the Lowland sea,
And he sunk them in the Lowlands low.

He leaned upon his breast and he swam back again,
Down in the Lowlands low,
Saying “Master, take me up, for I'm sure I will be slain,
And I've sunk them in the Lowland sea,
And I've sunk them in the Lowlands low.

“Oh, I'll not take you up,” the master he cried,
Down in the Lowlands low,
“But I'll shoot you and I'll kill you and send you with the tide,
And I'll drown you in the Lowland sea,
And I'll drown you in the Lowlands low.”

He leaned upon his breast and swam round the larboard side,
Down in the Lowlands low,
“Oh messmates, take me up for I fear I will been slain,
And I've sunk her in the Lowland sea,
And I've sunk her in the Lowlands low.”

His messmates took him up, and on the deck he died,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And they wrapped him up in an old cow's hide,
And they sunk him in the Lowland sea,
And sunk him in the Lowlands low.

All Among the Barley

Come out, 'tis now September, the hunters' moon's begun,
And through the wheaten stubble we hear the frequent gun;
The leaves are turning yellow, and fading into red,
While the ripe and bearded barley is hanging down its head.

Chorus (repeated after each verse):
All among the barley, who would not be blithe,
While the ripe and bearded barley is smiling on the scythe.

The wheat is like a rich man, it's sleek and well-to-do;
The oats are like a pack of girls, they're thin and dancing too;
The rye is like a miser, both sulky, lean and small,
Whilst the ripe and bearded barley is the monarch of them all.

The spring is like a young maid that does not know her mind,
The summer is a tyrant of most ungracious kind;
The autumn is an old friend that pleases all he can,
And brings the bearded barley to glad the heart of man.
