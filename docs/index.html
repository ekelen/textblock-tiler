ALL AMONG THE BARLEY

Now is come September, the hunter&#39;s moon begun
And through the wheaten stubble is heard the frequent gun
The leaves are pale and yellow, and kindling into red
And the ripe and bearded barley is hanging down its head

All among the barley, who would not be blithe
When the ripe and bearded barley is smiling on the scythe

The spring is like a young man who does not know his mind
The summer is a tyrant of most ungracious kind
The autumn&#39;s like an old friend, who loves one all she can
And she brings the bearded barley to glad the heart of man

The wheat is like a rich man, it&#39;s sleek and well-to-do
The oats are like a pack of girls, laughing and dancing too
The rye is like a miser, it&#39;s sulky, lean, and small
And the ripe and bearded barley is monarch of them all

Now is come September, the hunter&#39;s moon begun
And through the wheaten stubble is heard the frequent gun
The leaves are pale and yellow, and kindling into red
And the ripe and bearded barley is hanging down its head"

VEGAN LINZER COOKIES

Ingredients

    250 g (2.1 cups) flour
    50 g (1.7 oz) ground almonds
    200 g (0.8 cups) plant-based butter
    100 g (0.5 cups) sugar
    a pinch of salt
    if needed: cold water
    150 g (5.3 oz) raspberry jam (seedless)
    50 g (0.5 cups) icing sugar

Instructions

    Add flour, ground almonds, sugar, and salt to a bowl and stir to combine.
    Add diced cold plant-based butter on top. Start kneading with cold hands.
    If needed, add cold water and knead until a smooth dough forms.
    Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
    Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut out rounds. Use a smaller cutter to make a hole in the center of some rounds. In the end, you should get approx. Twenty-five rounds (the bottom of the cookies) and 25 rings (the top of the cookies). Place all of them on a baking tray covered with baking parchment.
    Pre-heat the oven up to 180°C/356°F and bake cookies for 8-10 minutes. Allow to cool down for 10 minutes.
    In the meantime heat the raspberry jam in a small pot.
	Spoon 1/2 teaspoon of the raspberry jam into the center of the round. Top with a cookies ring and sprinkle the cookies with icing sugar.

BLACK SPRUCE. SWAMP SPRUCE. DOUBLE SPRUCE. WATER SPRUCE.

=Habitat and Range.=--Swamps, sphagnum bogs, shores of rivers and ponds,
wet, rocky hillsides; not uncommon, especially northward, on dry uplands
and mountain slopes.

     Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, westward beyond the Rocky
     mountains, extending northward along the tributaries of the Yukon
     in Alaska.

Maine,--common throughout, covering extensive areas almost to the
exclusion of other trees in the central and northern sections,
occasional on the top of Katahdin (5215 feet); New Hampshire and
Vermont,--common in sphagnum swamps of low and high altitudes; the dwarf
form, var. _semi-prostrata_, occurs on the summit of Mt. Mansfield
(_Flora of Vermont_, 1900); Massachusetts,--frequent; Rhode Island,--not
reported; Connecticut,--rare; on north shore of Spectacle ponds in Kent
(Litchfield county), at an elevation of 1200 feet; Newton (Fairfield
county), a few scattered trees in a swamp at an altitude of 400 feet:
(New Haven county) a few small trees at Bethany; at Middlebury abundant
in a swamp of five acres (E. B. Harger, _Rhodora_, II, 126).

     South along the mountains to North Carolina and Tennessee; west
     through the northern tier of states to Minnesota.

=Habit.=--In New England, usually a small, slender tree, 10-30 feet high
and 5-8 inches in diameter; attaining northward and westward much
greater dimensions; reduced at high elevation to a shrub or dwarf tree,
2 or 3 feet high; trunk tapering very slowly, forming a narrow-based,
conical, more or less irregular head; branches rather short, scarcely
whorled, horizontal or more frequently declining with an upward tendency
at the ends, often growing in open swamps almost to the ground, the
lowest prostrate, sometimes rooting at their tips and sending up shoots;
spray stiff and rather slender; foliage dark bluish-green or glaucous.
This tree often begins to blossom after attaining a height of 2-5 feet,
the terminal cones each season remaining persistent at the base of the
branches, sometimes for many years.

=Bark.=--Bark of trunk grayish-brown, separating into rather close, thin
scales; branchlets roughened with the footstalks of the fallen leaves;
twigs in autumn dull reddish-brown with a minute, erect, pale, rusty
pubescence, or nearly smooth.

=Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds scaly, ovate, pointed, reddish-brown.
Leaves scattered, needle-shaped, dark bluish-green, the upper sides
becoming yellowish in the sunlight, the faces marked by parallel rows of
minute bluish dots which sometimes give a glaucous effect to the lower
surface or even the whole leaf on the new shoots, 4-angled, 1/4-3/4 of
an inch long, straight or slightly incurved, blunt at the apex, abruptly
tipped or mucronate, sessile on persistent, decurrent footstalks.

=Inflorescence.=--April to May, a week or two earlier than the red
spruce; sterile flowers terminal or axillary, on wood of the preceding
year; about 3/8 inch long, ovate; anthers madder-red: fertile flowers at
or near end of season&#39;s shoots, erect; scales madder-red, spirally
imbricated, broader than long, margin erose, rarely entire.

=Fruit.=--Cones, single or clustered at or near ends of the season&#39;s
shoots, attached to the upper side of the twig, but turning downward by
the twisting of the stout stalk, often persistent for years; 1/2-1-1/2
inches long; purplish or grayish brown at the end of the first season,
finally becoming dull reddish or grayish brown, ovate, ovate-oval, or
nearly globular when open; scales rigid, thin, reddish on the inner
surface; margin rounded, uneven, eroded, bifid, or rarely entire.

=Horticultural Value.=--Best adapted to cool, moist soils; of little
value under cultivation; young plants seldom preserving the broad-based,
cone-like, symmetrical heads common in the spruce swamps, the lower
branches dying out and the whole tree becoming scraggly and unsightly.
Seldom offered by nurserymen.

“Well met, well met, my own true love,
Long time I have been absent from thee.
I am lately come from the salt sea
And it&#39;s all for the sake, my love, of thee.”

“I have three ships all on the sea
And by one of them has brought me to land.
I&#39;ve four and twenty seamen on board
And you shall have music at your command.”

She says, “I am now wed to a ship&#39;s carpenter,
To a ship carpenter I am bound.
And I wouldn&#39;t leave my husband dear
For twice the sum of ten hundred pound.”

“Well I might have a king&#39;s daughter,
And fain she would have married me.
But I forsook her crown of gold
And it was all for the sake, my love, of thee.”

“So I pray you leave your husband, dear,
And sail away with me.
And I&#39;ll take you where the white lilies grow
All on the banks of Italy.”

“And this ship wherein my love shall sail
Is wondrous to behold.
The sails shall be of shining silk
And the mast shall be of red beaten gold.”

So she dressed herself in her gay clothing
Most glorious to behold,
And as she trod the salt water&#39;s side
Oh she shone like glittering gold.

They hadn&#39;t sailed a day and a day
And a day but barely three,
She cast herself down on the deck
And she wept and wailed most bitterly.

“Oh hold your tongue, my dearest dear,
Let all your sorrows be.
I&#39;ll take you where the white lilies grow
All on the bottom of the sea.”

And as she turned herself roundabout,
So tall and tall he seemed to be,
Until the tops of that gallant ship
No taller were than he.

And he struck the topmast with his hand,
The main mast with his knee,
And he broke that shining ship in two
And he dashed it into the bottom of the sea."

Oh, times are bad and wages are low,
    Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
I dare say it&#39;s time for us to go,
    It&#39;s time for us to leave her!

For there&#39;s Liverpool Pat in his tarpaulin hat
And Yankee John the packet rat.

Oh, mahogany beef and weevil bread,
We wish old Leatherface was dead.

Oh, I pray that I shall never see
A hungry ship the likes of she.

Oh, don&#39;t you hear our old man say,
Tomorrow you will get your pay.

Oh, she would neither win nor wear,
She&#39;s parted all her running gear."

Come out, &#39;tis now September, the hunters&#39; moon&#39;s begun,
And through the wheaten stubble we hear the frequent gun;
The leaves are turning yellow, and fading into red,
While the ripe and bearded barley is hanging down its head.

Chorus (repeated after each verse):
All among the barley, who would not be blithe,
While the ripe and bearded barley is smiling on the scythe.

The wheat is like a rich man, it&#39;s sleek and well-to-do;
The oats are like a pack of girls, they&#39;re thin and dancing too;
The rye is like a miser, both sulky, lean and small,
Whilst the ripe and bearded barley is the monarch of them all.

The spring is like a young maid that does not know her mind,
The summer is a tyrant of most ungracious kind;
The autumn is an old friend that pleases all he can,
And brings the bearded barley to glad the heart of man.
