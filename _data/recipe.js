VEGAN LINZER COOKIES

Ingredients

    250 g (2.1 cups) flour
    50 g (1.7 oz) ground almonds
    200 g (0.8 cups) plant-based butter
    100 g (0.5 cups) sugar
    a pinch of salt
    if needed: cold water
    150 g (5.3 oz) raspberry jam (seedless)
    50 g (0.5 cups) icing sugar

Instructions

    Add flour, ground almonds, sugar, and salt to a bowl and stir to combine.
    Add diced cold plant-based butter on top. Start kneading with cold hands.
    If needed, add cold water and knead until a smooth dough forms.
    Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
    Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut out rounds. Use a smaller cutter to make a hole in the center of some rounds. In the end, you should get approx. Twenty-five rounds (the bottom of the cookies) and 25 rings (the top of the cookies). Place all of them on a baking tray covered with baking parchment.
    Pre-heat the oven up to 180°C/356°F and bake cookies for 8-10 minutes. Allow to cool down for 10 minutes.
    In the meantime heat the raspberry jam in a small pot.
	Spoon 1/2 teaspoon of the raspberry jam into the center of the round. Top with a cookies ring and sprinkle the cookies with icing sugar.
