“Well met, well met, my own true love,
Long time I have been absent from thee.
I am lately come from the salt sea
And it's all for the sake, my love, of thee.”

“I have three ships all on the sea
And by one of them has brought me to land.
I've four and twenty seamen on board
And you shall have music at your command.”

She says, “I am now wed to a ship's carpenter,
To a ship carpenter I am bound.
And I wouldn't leave my husband dear
For twice the sum of ten hundred pound.”

“Well I might have a king's daughter,
And fain she would have married me.
But I forsook her crown of gold
And it was all for the sake, my love, of thee.”

“So I pray you leave your husband, dear,
And sail away with me.
And I'll take you where the white lilies grow
All on the banks of Italy.”

“And this ship wherein my love shall sail
Is wondrous to behold.
The sails shall be of shining silk
And the mast shall be of red beaten gold.”

So she dressed herself in her gay clothing
Most glorious to behold,
And as she trod the salt water's side
Oh she shone like glittering gold.

They hadn't sailed a day and a day
And a day but barely three,
She cast herself down on the deck
And she wept and wailed most bitterly.

“Oh hold your tongue, my dearest dear,
Let all your sorrows be.
I'll take you where the white lilies grow
All on the bottom of the sea.”

And as she turned herself roundabout,
So tall and tall he seemed to be,
Until the tops of that gallant ship
No taller were than he.

And he struck the topmast with his hand,
The main mast with his knee,
And he broke that shining ship in two
And he dashed it into the bottom of the sea.`;
