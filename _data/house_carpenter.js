THE HOUSE CARPENTER

	Well met, well met, my own true love
	Well met, well met, cried he
	I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
	All for the love of thee

	Well I could have married the King's daughter, dear
	She would have married me
	But I have forsaken her crowns of gold
	All for the love of thee

	Well, if you could have married the King's daughter, dear
	I know you are to blame
	For I am married to a house carpenter
	And I find him a nice young man

	Oh, will you forsake your house carpenter
	And go along with me?
	I'll take you to where the grass grows green
	To the banks of the salt, salt sea

	Well, if I should forsake my house carpenter
	And go along with thee
	What have you got to maintain me on
	And keep me from poverty?

	Six ships, six ships all out on the sea
	Seven more upon dry land
	One hundred and ten all brave sailor men
	Will be at your command

	So she picked up her own wee babe
	Kisses she gave him three
	Said, stay right here with my house carpenter
	And keep him good company

	Well, they had not been gone about two weeks
	I know it wasn't three
	For our fair lady began to weep
	She wept most bitterly
	She wept most bitterly
	She wept most bitterly`;
