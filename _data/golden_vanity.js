The Golden Vanity

It's I've got a ship in the north country,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And I fear she may be took by the Spanish enemy,
As she sails in the Lowland sea,
As she sails in the Lowland low.

And up then stepped a little cabin boy,
Down in the Lowlands low,
Saying: “What will you give me if I do them destroy
And sink them in the Lowland sea
And sink them in the Lowlands low?”

“Oh, I'll give you silver and likewise gold,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And my only daughter for to be your bride,
If you'll sink them in the Lowland sea,
If you'll sink them in the Lowlands low.”

“Oh wrap me up in my black bear skin,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And heave me overboard for to sink or to swim,
And I'll sink them in the Lowland sea
I'll sink them in the Lowlands low.

Now some were playing cards and others playing dice,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And the boy he had an auger, bored two holes at once,
And he sunk them in the Lowland sea,
And he sunk them in the Lowlands low.

He leaned upon his breast and he swam back again,
Down in the Lowlands low,
Saying “Master, take me up, for I'm sure I will be slain,
And I've sunk them in the Lowland sea,
And I've sunk them in the Lowlands low.

“Oh, I'll not take you up,” the master he cried,
Down in the Lowlands low,
“But I'll shoot you and I'll kill you and send you with the tide,
And I'll drown you in the Lowland sea,
And I'll drown you in the Lowlands low.”

He leaned upon his breast and swam round the larboard side,
Down in the Lowlands low,
“Oh messmates, take me up for I fear I will been slain,
And I've sunk her in the Lowland sea,
And I've sunk her in the Lowlands low.”

His messmates took him up, and on the deck he died,
Down in the Lowlands low,
And they wrapped him up in an old cow's hide,
And they sunk him in the Lowland sea,
And sunk him in the Lowlands low.

W. Bolton of Southport, Lancashire, sang The Golden Vanity in 1906 to Ann Gilchrist [VWML RoudFS/S146425] . In some versions of this widespread and well-known ballad with many versions, the enemy is Turkish, Spanish or French. Fundamentally, it is a story of betrayal and rarely does it have a happy ending. Sometimes the boy drowns and his ghost returns to sink his own ship. Mr Bolton explained that the “black bear skin” was the cabin boy's covering at night; he wished to wear it as a disguise in the water. Version have been reported from Wiltshire and Cornwall, some cite the hero as being Sir Walter Raleigh.
